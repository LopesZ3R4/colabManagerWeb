# Employee Manager

**Employee Manager - Angular Frontend**

This project serves as the frontend for the Employee Manager application, which is built using Angular and interacts with a Java Spring backend and a PostgreSQL database.

## Overview

The primary focus of this project is to create a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface to manage employee information, including their name, role, salary, date of birth, and date of joining. However, this is just the foundation for a more comprehensive and ambitious system.

## Future Features

The goal behind this project is to expand its functionality over time. I plan to add various features, such as:

- **Payments**: Integration of employee payment information, including salary calculations, bonuses, deductions, and payment history.
- **Roles and Departments**: Addition of role and department categories for better organization and segmentation of employees.
- **Transfers**: Implementation of features to record and manage employee transfers between departments or locations.
- **Reports and Analytics**: Creation of tools to generate reports and analyses on various aspects of employees and the company.

## Public Access

This repository is public to share progress, ideas, and development of the project with the wider community. I encourage anyone interested to explore the code, make suggestions, and contribute constructively.
